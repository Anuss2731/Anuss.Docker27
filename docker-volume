when we stop the ontainer in the host machine the data init will be del means if u have database and there is
data store if u stop the container it del all the data in it.Volume is used to store the data after container 
stop
docker volume create the separate space in the host vm/we can give one volume to diff cont
we also write this code in the yuml doker composed file

docker run -it -v /user/anuss/root/volcume:/root/test/volcume ubuntu 
{-v define the cretae volcume and afterthat there is the path of host machine where data is store after (:)
there is path of continer where conatiner data store}

docker volume ls 'list of volume'
docker create volume volume-name 'create the volume,there is default location where these volume create 
                                  that are /var/lib/docker/volumes'
docker rm volume volume-name     'del the volume'
docker run -v volume-name:cont-path 'its attach the existing volume with the cont,if not exist then it create
                                     with the name that u give'

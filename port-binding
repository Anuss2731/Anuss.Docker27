docker run -p80:3306 images-name (run image and create the connection with the cont and the vm.80 is vm 
                                  port and 3306 is docker cont default port.bind the host port with the
                                  cont port.reuest of host vm forward to cont with this)
#with same host port of vm we cannot bind the two container 
#we need two diff port of vm to bind the cont
#cont may have same port its not create the issue
